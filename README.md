# Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers

As a mechanical engineer, we design and apply machines and employ applied physics in commercial machines, transportation vehicles, bio-medical devices, manufacturing of products, and different types of machines in myriad other areas. Modern machines are integrated with numerous sensors and are continuously generating data of various sorts. Being able to findout pattern from these data is surely critical in providing accurate, adaptive and smarter results.

Machine Learning is one of key ingredient for developing a system that can perceive its environment, think and reason to take certain decision or plan certain actions to interact with the environment, aka artificial intelligence.
